# Machine learning and deep learning 

These are my currently notes on topics of machine learning and deep learning
from various courses from schools of machine learning with applications to a wide
variaty of topics in physics from particle to physics to cosmology and online courses
from different academies.

Lecture notes from different schools
- [X] The School of Machine Learning in Physics, Physics without frontiers Chile - 2025.

Current topics covered in the lecture notes are divided into three major categories,
machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing. Notes of machine learning 
are:
- [X] Linear regression.
- [X] Logistic regression.
- [X] K nearest neighbours.
- [X] Decision trees and random forest.
- [X] Support vector machine (SVC).
- [X] K means clustering.

Notes of deep learning:
- [X] Tensorflow keras code project 1.
